Code and data for Generator based approach to analyze mutations in genomic datasets

(1) The functions used to generate the state machine are provided in important_functions.ipynb, and the pickle file for any fasta file can be generated using create_pickle.ipynb.

(2) For Figure 2a,b,c,d,e,f, please use the Fig2_synthetic_data.ipynb.

(3) For Figure 2g,h, please use PCA_strains.ipynb. GISAID acknowledgement files for the samples used in Fig 2g are provided in the folder G_L_GR and for Fig 2h are provided in the folder UK_SA_Braz.

(4) For Figure 3, please use Intra_Strain_Evolution.ipynb. GISAID acknowledgement files for the samples used are provided in the folder continuous_evol.

(5) For Figure 4 and 6, please use Mutation_detection_time.ipynb

(6) For Figure 5, please use mutation_detection_region.ipynb. GISAID acknowledgement files for the samples used are provided in the folder samples_used_figure_5.
